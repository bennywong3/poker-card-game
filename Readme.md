Backup for the mini card game done in Java. You can see the details of this game in the video and pdf

as4_cmd file is for cmd use. I deleted all the bin, src, class, etc created by eclipse. There is only one java file and one Images folder.
as4_eclipse is the original version created using eclipse. When I was doing assignment, my Images folder is located inside src folder.
The path of Images is different for as4_eclipse and as4_cmd. 
If you encounter any bugs in as4_cmd, please use eclipse to open as4_eclipse instead.
